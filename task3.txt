advantages
1. Randomly, but smartly, generates junit tests that can combine sequences of method and can invoke constructors for the classes under test.
2. Can easily estimate the reliability of the software, because there is a large amount of test case, therefore can easily cover input space, and we cannot do this manually.

disadvantage
1. the cost of test code maintenance is high.
2. The regression tests generated a few thousand lines of test code in a few seconds, comprising 870 test cases. 
3. Some of these used more than 20 variables, with confusing names like var1, var2, â€¦ varN, making any deep understanding of the test
programs impossible. 
4.  human is not able to control values for arguments to tests (which were randomized), making it impossible
to guarantee equivalence partition coverage on inputs.
